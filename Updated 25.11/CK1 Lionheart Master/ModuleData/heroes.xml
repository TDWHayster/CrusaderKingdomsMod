He is an able statesman, an excellent military commander and an astute administrator. During his early life, Fredrick was the Duke of Swabia, though when his uncle, Conrad the III died, he became the next Holy Roman Emperor, holding the thrones of Germany, Italy and Burgundy. Now, the Emperor wants nothing more than to take back the Holy Land from the infidels that now plague it. Beware the might of the Holy Roman Empire." />

Arenicos was indeed loved, and also there are some Calradians who believe that the endless squabbling and civil wars can only be overcome by a king, or, if necessary, by a queen. " />
